# newTabLinking

the chrome extension to open all link in a new tab

Personal demand,I like open a link in a new tab, not in current page. 

In order to achieve it, every time I browse the Internet page,I alick an a link with pressing the command key.

It‘s very troublesome，so I decide to make a chrome extension to do it

The source code is very simple,but the effect is very large for me.

LOL
